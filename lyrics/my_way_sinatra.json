'{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","lyrics":"And now, the end is here\\nAnd so I face the final curtain\\nMy friend, I\'ll say it clear\\nI\'ll state my case, of which I\'m certain\\nI\'ve lived a life that\'s full\\nI traveled each and ev\'ry highway\\nAnd more, much more than this, I did it my way\\n\\nRegrets, I\'ve had a few\\nBut then again, too few to mention\\nI did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption\\nI planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway\\nAnd more, much more than this, I did it my way\\n\\nYes, there were times, I\'m sure you knew\\nWhen I bit off more than I could chew\\nBut through it all, when there was doubt\\nI ate it up and spit it out\\nI faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way\\n\\nI\'ve loved, I\'ve laughed and cried\\nI\'ve had my fill, my share of losing\\nAnd now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing\\nTo think I did all that\\nAnd may I say, not in a shy way,\\n\'Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way\'\\n\\nFor what is a man, what has he got?\\nIf not himself, then he has naught\\nTo say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels\\nThe record shows I took the blows and did it my way!\\n\\n[instrumental]\\n\\nYes, it was my way","title":"My Way","asset":"my_way_sinatra.mp3","id":"my_way_sinatra"}'
